# **üì¶ Parcel Delivery Frontend (React + Redux Toolkit + RTK Query)**

---

## **Project Overview**

Build a **secure, role-based, and user-friendly** frontend application for a **Parcel Delivery System** (similar to Pathao Courier or Sundarban) using **React.js**, **Redux Toolkit**, and **RTK Query**.

This app will consume the backend Parcel Delivery API to enable **Senders**, **Receivers**, and **Admins** to perform parcel operations and manage records seamlessly.

You will create:

- A **public landing page** with basic service info
- A **role-based dashboard interface** with tailored features for each user type
- Robust **state management and API integration** via Redux Toolkit & RTK Query
- Responsive and clean UI

---

## **Tech Stack**

**Frontend:**

- React, React Router, Redux Toolkit, RTK Query
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS (styling)

**Backend:**

- Node.js/Express (REST API)
- MongoDB/Mongoose (data modeling)
- JWT + bcrypt (secure authentication)
